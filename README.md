# FujiLenses

Playing around for now. The aim is to create a simple single page application that allows the user to browse Fuji X lenses interactively.

## TODO

Pretty much everything at this point but main items:

* Reorganize file structure and deploy code
* Add an interactive view (somewhat similar to the official Fuji roadmap picture)
* Create better looks/design and add other fluff like footer, etc.
* Make truly mobile friendly
